    Tiny Improvements is a newsletter for people designing and building great products.

    I'll share my experience building products as a serial entrepreneur, UX Designer, and front-end developer. I write about tips, tools, and techniques for creating engaging experiences, building great customer relationships, and finding the right audience.

    - Design for developers
    - React, Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, Markdown, Markdoc, and MDX
    - CSS-in-JS, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, and Chakra UI
    - GraphQL, Apollo, and Prisma
    - Jamstack, Serverless, and Static Site Generators
    - Firebase, Supabase, SQL, and other database technologies
    - Web Components, WebAssembly, and Web APIs
    - Accessibility, Inclusive Design, and User Experience
    - Product Management, Customer Development, and Lean Startup
    - Remote Work, Remote Teams, and Remote Leadership
    - Personal Development, Self-Improvement, and Personal Growth
