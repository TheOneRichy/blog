# WTF is this?

This is an annoying hack that I put in place as a countermeasure to get MDX-embed components working in next.js. I was having a mountain of problems related to esmodules from MDX Embed not working in my next.js project for ages. I waited patiently for a solution, and even tried to figure out a fix myself (the OSS dream!), but my typescriptery wasn't up to snuff.

This is a hack. Don't do this.

Use the MDX-embed package from its proper home: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-embed
