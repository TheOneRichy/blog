# Here's why you should be pissed off about design

## (And why I am, too)

üëã Hi. I thought it might make some sense to preface this post with some of my bona fides. I'm Mike Bifulco - among other things, I'm technical director for [thegymnasium.com](https://thegymnasium.com). I'm also co-authoring a [book about using APIs](https://leanpub.com/surviving-other-peoples-web-apis) as a design expert (which will never not feel like a strange thing to say about myself). I've got a degree in Computer Science from UConn, and an HCI Masters from DePaul University (well, most of one. I got busy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) .

In a past life, I was a UX Consultant in Microsoft's Americas Services Consulting business. Basically, when _other companies_ came to Microsoft to have some software custom made for their _problem-du-jour_, I was on the crack team of masochists who would be tossed into the fray to figure out how to turn their business goals into functioning, enterprise-class software.

I've also started-and-stopped many personal projects in the world of software, publishing, content creation, IoT, and likely a few other things I've forgotten.

I co-host an on-again-off-again [podcast about design](https://www.letstalkdesign.net/) with my good friend and colleague Andrew Miller.

I've spoken at regional and national conferences about design, and from time-to-time I've done freelance design consulting to help folks build their dreams.

Put another way: I've seen all kinds of shit.

# So, about design

It was an absolute revelation for me to realize that design isn't just a touchy-feely thing. For quite a long time I was (incorrectly) under the impression that good designers had some inherent personality trait or instinct that the rest-of-us were missing. Once I understood that design could be _learned_, I was all-in. I love reading about this stuff, and I'm fascinated by the research and the science behind design. _(Side note: when you finish this post, you should go read about [The Milgram Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment). Science has taken some dark turns!)_

For me, going to school for design was a blessing and a curse. I learned
