## Semantic HTML makes your sites better

Semantic HTML is important because it helps improve the accessibility of a web page and makes the code more readable. Semantic elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a way that is easy for both humans and machines to understand.

Search engines can more easily parse and understand semantic HTML, [which can help improve your website's SEO](https://developers.google.com/style/semantic-tagging). Semantic HTML uses tags to describe the meaning of content on a page, rather than just its presentation. This can help search engines better understand the content of a page and index it appropriately.

### Using h2 as a subtitle for an h1 is incorrect

According to the [html spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#heading-content-2), `h1` through `h6` tags are meant to indicate the structure of a document. In other words, each page should have at most 1 `<h1>` tag, and `<h2>` elements should be _sub-sections_ of that `h1` - not additional descriptions for it.

This warning From the HTML spec does a great job of explaining it:

> For example, the following snippet, intended to represent the heading of a corporate site, is non-conforming because the second line is not intended to be a heading of a subsection, but merely a subheading or subtitle (a subordinate heading for the same section).

## Use this code to add subtitles to headings

The correct semantic structure of HTML for a heading with a subtitle is straightforward - nest your `<h1>`, etc with in a `<hgroup>` tag, and include a `<p>` tag with an appropriate class name as a sibling to that `h1`. Note that this same structure applies to `h2`-`h6` as well:

```html
<hgroup>
  <h1>How to bootstrap a product as a solo founder</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Important lessongs learned from building 10 products on my own in 2 years
  </p>
</hgroup>
```

For more details on this, check out the [semantics section of the WHATWG html spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#semantics-2).
