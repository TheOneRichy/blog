The [Orton Effect](https://www.capturelandscapes.com/orton-effect-explained/) is a photography technique that involves taking two pictures of the same scene, one with a long exposure and one with a shorter exposure, and then combining them. The result is an image that has both the sharpness of the long exposure and the detail of the shorter exposure. While it's not an exact replica, we can simulate the Orton Effect using CSS and React.

## Emulating the Orton Effect in CSS

To emulate the Orton Effect in CSS, we need to layer 2 copies of the same image on top of one other. To accomplish that, we'll nest them under a single parent - in this case, the [`figure` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/html/element/figure). Note that for the second image, we set [`aria-hidden=true`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-hidden), so that people using Screen Readers. won't encounter the repeated image element. You can read more about that and other accessibility features of HTML on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-hidden).

```html
<figure class="orton-effect">
  <img
    src="https://source.unsplash.com/P-yzuyWFEIk/1600x900"
    alt="Autumn foliage over a beautiful pond"
  />
  <img
    src="https://source.unsplash.com/P-yzuyWFEIk/1600x900"
    aria-hidden="true"
  />
</figure>
```

Next, we'll use a CSS rule to apply some styles to the _first_ of the two images (in HTML-speak, that's the one on top).

```css
figure.orton-effect img:first-of-type {
  position: absolute;
  mix-blend-mode: lighten;
  filter: blur(10px);
  opacity: 25%;
}
```

We're setting `position: absolute;` to layer this image on top of its sibling within the `<figure>` element. The remaining 3 lines of CSS set the top image to use the `lighten` blend mode, apply a gaussian blur using `filter`, and make the top image partly translucent by way of the `opacity` CSS property.

This creates a hazy, glassy effect:

### Before:

<img

  alt="A snowy landscape"
/>

### After:

<OrtonEffectImage
  src={'https://source.unsplash.com/P-yzuyWFEIk/1600x900'}
  alt="Autumn foliage over a beautiful pond"
  blur={10}
  opacity={25}
/>

## The Orton Effect in Action

<OrtonEffectImage
