## Milgram's Experiment

In 1961, a Yale University researcher named Stanley Milgram conducted a series of experiments as a part of his research on behavioral psychology. The goal of the experiment was to test participants' tendency to obey authority figures when under pressure.

Throughout the course of the experiment, the experiment was conducted on 40 volunteers; all men between the ages of 20 and 50, with a variety of education and economic backgrounds.

The results of the now infamous experiment were extremely unexpected.

### The Experiment: Setup

Participants who were asked to take part in a study on learning and memory. Each study was led guided by an "experimenter" dressed in a lab coat, who explained to participants that they'd be doing a "scientific study on memory and learning". When they arrived, participants were paired with an actor who they were _told_ was another participant in the study.

The actor was actually a confederate of the researcher, and was instructed to play the role of a learner.

The study participant was given the role of "teacher". The experimenter then explained that the study would involve the Teacher asking the Learner series of questions. For each incorrect answer, the Teacher would be asked to hit a button to administer an electric shock to the actor. Subsequent incorrect answers would result in a shock of increasing intensity, from 15V to 450V.

The learner was strapped into a device that looked like an electric chair, and then separated from the teacher so that they could not see one-another.

In reality, there were no real shocks being administered, but this was unknown to the study participant playing the role of the Teacher. The actor playing the role of the Learner was instructed to pretend to be in pain, and recordings of increasingly alarming cries of pain were played when shocks were administered.

When the highest shock level was reached, the learner fell completely silent.

During the experiment, if the teacher showed hesitation to continue the experiment, the experimenter gave them a series of specific instructions to continue:

1. Please go on.
1. The experiment requires that you continue.
1. It is _absolutely essential_ that you continue.
1. You have no other choice; you _must_ go on.

These "prods" were given in order, and the second was only given if the teacher refused to continue after the first (and so on).

The experiment was halted when the teacher refused to continue despite all four prods, or when the teacher reached the highest shock level three times in a row.

## What would you do?

Let's take a minute to pause here - put yourself in the shoes of the teacher. You're in a lab, and you're told that you're taking part in a study on learning and memory. Everything you're seeing and hearing seems to be controlled, official, and legititmate.

Do you think you would continue to administer shocks to the learner, even when they were clearly in pain?

What do you think the average person would do?

## The Experiment: Results

As you might expect, every participant in the study indicated a desire to stop the experiment at least once.

Before conducting the experiment, researchers surveyed a cohort of students and fellow researchers, to get a sense of what they thought the average person would do. The average guess was that 1.2% of people would continue the experiment through the full 450V shock.

However, the actual results of the experiment revealed a surprising truth about human behavior:

> Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process.

## A call to action

Friends, it's time to leave Twitter. Shutter your accounts, delete the app, and move on. I know it's hard, but it's time. Every moment you spent on Twitter is feeding legitimacy to a platform that is enabling abusers, endangering global politics, and destroying the fabric of our society.

It is no longer acceptable to stay aboard the ship as it sinks - to stay active on Twitter is a vanity, and a bath in your own privilege.

Bring your voice and your conversations elsewhere, and send the message that with its current leadership, Twitter is no longer a place for you.
