## Milgram's Experiment

In 1961, a Yale University researcher named Stanley Milgram conducted a series of experiments as a part of his research on behavioral psychology. The goal of the experiment was to test participants' tendency to obey authority figures when under pressure.

Throughout the course of the experiment, the experiment was conducted on 40 volunteers; all men between the ages of 20 and 50, with a variety of education and economic backgrounds.

Milgram later summarized findings from the experiment in an essay titled "The Perils of Obedience". The results were extremely unexpected.

### The Experiment: Setup

Participants who were asked to take part in a study on learning and memory. Each study was led guided by an _Experimenter_ dressed in a lab coat, who explained to participants that they'd be doing a "scientific study on memory and learning". When they arrived, participants were paired with an actor who they were _told_ was another participant in the study.

The actor was secretly working with the researcher, and during the experiment was instructed to play the role of a _Learner_.

The study participant was given the role of _Teacher_. The experimenter then explained that the study would involve the Teacher asking the Learner series of questions. For each incorrect answer, the Teacher would be asked to hit a button to administer an electric shock to the actor. Subsequent incorrect answers would result in a shock of increasing intensity, from 15V to 450V.

The learner was strapped into a device that looked like an electric chair, and then separated from the teacher so that they could not see one-another.

In reality, there were no real shocks being administered, but this was unknown to the study participant playing the role of the Teacher. The actor playing the role of the Learner was instructed to pretend to be in pain, and recordings of increasingly alarming cries of pain were played when shocks were administered.

When the highest shock level was reached, the learner fell completely silent.

During the experiment, if the teacher showed hesitation to continue the experiment, the experimenter gave them a series of specific instructions to continue:

1. Please go on.
1. The experiment requires that you continue.
1. It is _absolutely essential_ that you continue.
1. You have no other choice; you _must_ go on.

These "prods" were given in order, and the second was only given if the teacher refused to continue after the first (and so on).

The experiment was halted when the teacher refused to continue despite all four prods, or when the teacher reached the highest shock level three times in a row.

### What would you do?

Let's take a minute to pause here - put yourself in the shoes of the teacher. You're in a lab, and you're told that you're taking part in a study on learning and memory. Everything you're seeing and hearing seems to be controlled, official, and legititmate.

Do you think you would continue to administer shocks to the learner, even when they were clearly in pain?

What do you think the average person would do?

### The Experiment: Results

As you might expect, every participant in the study indicated a desire to stop the experiment at least once.

Before conducting the experiment, researchers surveyed a cohort of students and fellow researchers, to get a sense of what they thought the average person would do. The average guess was that 1.2% of people would continue the experiment through the full 450V shock.

However, the actual results of the experiment revealed a surprising truth about human behavior:

Recreations of this experiment have produced similar results, [as recently as 2009](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2008/12/replicating-milgram).

## Obedience and the Perils of Twitter

I can't help but draw a connection between the Milgram experiment and the current state of Twitter. The experiment was designed to test the willingness of people to obey authority figures. Twitter's recent acquisition by a megalomaniacal celebrity narcissist is an amplified example of this phenomenon in action.

Under Musk's leadership, Twitter's employee base has been slashed from 7,500 to approximately 2,000 in the last month, in an attempt to cut costs after a purchase that only made sense for a rich, vein billionaire who wanted to flex his ego.

I've seen plenty of discussion online that many of twitter's remaining engineers are likely tied to H1B visas, and are unable to leave their job without risking deportation. There is no doubt another contingent of employees who believe in Musk's vision, who are bought into the idea of being an elite engineer working on a desperately slim team, and are willing to work for him despite the fact that he's a complete and utter asshole.

I don't think it is a stretch to say that employees at Twitter are being treated poorly, and have been given increasingly shocking orders from their new CEO (for example, [1](https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1593649356661436417), [2](https://twitter.com/alexeheath/status/1595701492006014977?t=7MMiqyX0-LWIXExz6QtkAQ&s=19)).

Since rumors of Musk's takeover, legions of advertisers have pulled their ad spend from Twitter, for fear of being associated with the company. The company's income has plummeted, and Musk is clearly trying to cut costs wherever he can, while adding features as a part of a desperate money grab to keep the company from going bankrupt.

I left twitter recently, shortly after a hasty user poll resulted in the reinstatement of former (and twice-impeached) president Trump's account.

<Tweet align="center" tweetLink="irreverentmike/status/1594455660040572928" />

Since then, another hasty poll has resulted in an absolutely staggering policy change: all\* accounts that were previously suspended for violating Twitter's rules will be reinstated.

<Tweet align="center" tweetLink="elonmusk/status/1595473875847942146" />

Pandora's box has been opened, and the monsters are coming back. Twitter is now a platform for hate speech, misinformation, and disinformation. It's will become a cesspool of conspiracy theories, and a breeding ground for countless nightmares and real-world dangers.

This is a very real, very observable truth: countless racists, abusers, and other dangerous people are being given "amnesty" to come back the platform.

I've seen many others abandon their twitter accounts in the wake of these changes, but -- friends -- I'm honestly shocked that so many people choose to remain.

Why are so many people still on twitter, administer electric shocks to the collective public by keeping their accounts alive?

I'm reminded by the words of Stanley Milgram, in his reflection on the results of his now-infamous experiment:

> Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively **few people have the resources needed to resist authority.**

For many people, Twitter was a place to connect with friends, family, and colleagues. I know many people with follower counts in the tens of thousands, who have built a career around their twitter presence. I can understand a deep hesitancy to abandon a platform that has been so central to your life.

But fam, seriously -- **if not now, when?**

## A call to action

Friends, it's time to leave Twitter. Shutter your accounts, delete the app, and move on. I know it's hard, but it's time. Every moment you spent on Twitter is feeding legitimacy to a platform that is enabling abusers, endangering global politics, and destroying the fabric of our society.

It is no longer acceptable to stay aboard the ship as it sinks - to stay active on Twitter despite their new policies and leadership is a vanity, a bath in your own privilege.

Bring your voice and your conversations elsewhere, and send the message that with its current leadership, Twitter is no longer a place for you.

## Footnote: on the ethics of the Milgram Experiment

It's important to note that in the years since Milgram Experiment was conducted, it has been criticized for its methodology. [Research Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research#Research_ethics) is a complex and nuanced topic, and I don't believe that the experiment would be approved by modern ethics boards in its original form. However, I believe that the results of the experiment are still relevant, and that the experiment itself is still a valuable tool for understanding human behavior.

The experiment _has_ been recreated in a more ethical manner, with the same results. [This article](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2008/12/replicating-milgram) from the American Psychological Association summarizes the results of a 2008 replication of the experiment, which was conducted by a team of researchers at Yale University. In this version of the study, participants were screened to ensure that they were not at risk of being harmed by the experiment, and were given the option to withdraw from the study at any time. The maximum simulated voltage level for the Learner was also decreased to 150V, and a test shock given to participants was given at 15V, as compared to 45V in Milgram's original study.

The results of the 2009 study were the similar to the original experiment.
