# Oh, hello üëãüèº

My name is Mike Bifulco - I'm a an author, podcaster, designer, and developer. I've been using my site [mikebifulco.com](https://mikebifulco.com) to publish tutorials, guides, and articles about building products, creativity, and the tools we use to get things done.

# My work

## üìã Writing

I write about all sorts of things:

- Advice for founders and other product builders, like [Choosing the right CRM](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/how-do-you-choose-the-right-crm-for-your-product) and using [ConvertKit](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/publish-your-newsletter-with-convertkit-api-next-js)
- Dev tutorials on things like React, Next.js, Remix, and other web technologies
- Design-related topics, like [Semantic HTML](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/semantic-html-heading-subtitle) and [The Orton Effect](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/orton-effect-css-react)

I also publish a newsletter called [Tiny Improvements](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter), where I share my thoughts on designing & building great products, and philosophy for living a life you love in an ever-changing world.

## üéôÔ∏è Podcasting

I currently host 3 podcasts:

- [Tiny Improvements](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tiny-improvements/id1577037667?uo=4) A short-form (~10min) show where I dive into philosophy and experience
- [APIs You Won't Hate](https://apisyouwonthate.com/podcast): Just like it sounds, a podcast for people who design and build APIs. All our work is Open Source at [github.com/apisyouwonthate](https://github.com/apisyouwonthate), and we have a great community of experts. Come check it out!
- [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) I occasional host episodes of this show, where I interview executives and experts from across the tech industry

## üìπ Video / Live Streaming

- Occasionally, I live stream my dev work on [twitch.tv/irreverentmike](https://twitch.tv/irreverentmike) and [youtube.com/mikebifulco](https://youtube.com/mikebifulco?sub_confirmation=1)
- I also post pre-recording tutorials to my YouTube channel from time to time @ [youtube.com/mikebifulco](https://youtube.com/mikebifulco?sub_confirmation=1)

# Consider sponsoring

Everything you see here is produced alongside my fulltime job.

Paradoxically, as my writing has found a footing in the tech world and become more popular, hosting costs have started to get out of hand. I'm currently paying about $200/mo in costs for hosting, and SaaS subscriptions for producing audio and video content.

I share my learning and experience with the world because I want to help others turn their interests and expertise into opportunity. I'm not looking to make a living from this, but I do want to be able to continue to produce content and help people.

If you enjoy my work, and can afford to toss me a few bucks each month, please consider sponsoring me.

‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you!

## Sponsorship goal

My current goal is to reach $200/mo in sponsorship to cover the cost of hosting and the tools I use to produce content.
