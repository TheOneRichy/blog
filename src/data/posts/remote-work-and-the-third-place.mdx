I live in a fast-growing city in the southeast US, where urban design and city planning are always a hot topic. As population density has increased, it's become apparent that Charlotte's city planners need to make drastic and sweeping changes to accommodate the growing number of people living in the area.

Naturally, this means meant I'm also reading heaps about urban planning - which is where I first heard the term **third place** being used.

## What is the third place?

As defined by [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders):

> (...the) **Third place** is a term coined by sociologist Ray Oldenburg, referring to _places where people spend time between home ('first' place) and work ('second' place)._

Third places have traditionally been where people go to socialize, to relax, and to be a part of their community. You've probably seen them in urban areas, in the form of a town square, piazza, or public park. They might also be a subway station, a heavily trafficked intersection, or a kiosk on a street corner.

These spaces are important for people to feel like they _belong,_ and have purpose beyond just home and work. It gives space for one to decompress and find entertainment, to find reprieve from the pressures of work and home life.

## Suburban living erases the third place

Notably, for people living in _suburban_ places, the third place may be completely missing - it's not uncommon for folks commuting from the suburbs to _skip_ third places as they drive straight to and from work. As you might imagine, this means that people living like this don't experience the benefits of a third place in the same way that an on-foot commuter might.

## The third place and remote work

People who work remotely may find themselves one degree further away from a third place - living and working in the same place can create a life with only _one_ place - blurring the lines between home-space and work-space.

This makes finding the benefits of a third place even more challenging.

The past two years of pandemic-living have been extremely challenging for all of us - and for many, adapting to remote work has had a steep learning curve. (Quick privilege note: even with these struggles in mind, I'm lucky to have an exceptionally charmed life. There are countless people who have been through an unimaginable hell during the pandemic. I do not mean to trivilize or minimize their experiences in any way.)

I have found that in order to work remotely and live well, I have needed to make a concerted effort to build a life that intentionally includes second and third places that fit into my routines.

## The three spaces we tend to occupy

### The first place: home sweet home

### The second place: the space where you work

### The third place: community, socialization, and balance

For each of us, the third place will be a unique choice. It might be your favorite coffee shop, your back yard, a coffee shop you love, a beach, a hiking trail, or something completely different. What's important here is that the third space is literally anything other than where you do home-things and office-things - if you work from home, this has to work for you. Find something that makes you feel good, energized, empowered, different. For me, this has taken many forms:

**Coworking spaces** - obviously near and dear to my heart, since I once built a company for coworking. These are great because they supplant your typical work community with likeminded, colocated people who don't have the same problems as you. You can complain to them **or unplug completely from work** and just hang out. In my experience, people are far more likely to have a eureka moment at a coworking space than in the stuffy hallways of your typical cube farm or open office.

Serendipity is a happy byproduct of interacting with people who don't have the same colleagues as you. Their problems and joys are different, and they can share their perspective on your world, just as you can do the same for them.

**Cafes** - My god, do I love a good cafe. As a self-taught home barista, I have access to world-class espresso and coffeemaking gear, and yet I still spend plenty of time at cafes (pandemic allowing, of course). This is because, for me, there's a change in mindset at a cafe. I know I typically have 60min-2hrs of comfortable time at any given cafe, and I can hammer through some really great work during this time. It also requires transit/transition time on either side of it, where I can clear my mind, give myself a break, see nature, go for a bike ride/drive/etc. This has a multiplicative effect on my productivity - small doses of repose are amazing.

**Just being outside** - many times, I'll use the great outdoors as my third space. Going for a **long** walk in the morning (1-2hrs) while listening to a podcast can set my energy for the day. When I know I've got calls/meetings/deadlines all day, this helps me to feel like I haven't burned an entire day behind my computer screen. This can also take the form of a run or a bike ride or (whatever you do to exercise) - turning your mind off of work really is a booster. Don't let hustle porn ruin your perception of your own throughput (but don't lie to yourself, either). At the end of the day, you still have to get things done, but doing so with a mindful eye on balance can keep you healthier and happier in the long run.

There are also times where I know I'll be on a super long call (30min+) where I just need to **listen** - going for a walk during these calls (even in super hot or super cold weather) is often a guarantee that I'll pay better attention to the content of the call than if I'm left to poke around in my browser, on twitter, reddit, etc. I have several regular 1:1s with teammates where this is the expectation and the norm. Even though we're not in the same place, we will pop our earbuds in and go for a walk at the same time, talking together like a normal old phonecall instead of performing business-normality in front of a web cam.

## Conclusion

Generally, I've been extremely happy as a remote worker for a long time by creating a series of _third places_ for myself.

## Publications about Third Places:

- [The Wellbeing thesis](https://thewellbeingthesis.org.uk/foundations-for-success/importance-of-taking-breaks-and-having-other-interests/) says breaks can reduce or prevent stress, help to maintain performance throughout the day and reduce the need for a long recovery at the end of the day
- [How Do Work Breaks Help Your Brain?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/changepower/201704/how-do-work-breaks-help-your-brain-5-surprising-answers) says _“Movement breaks” are essential for your physical and emotional health, and that breaks restore motivation, especially for long-term goals._
- [Atomic Habits](https://atomichabits.com) - habits are the compound interest of self-improvement, and finding a (series of) third place(s) is a _huge_ part of that - there's a great [primer video on Atomic Habits](https://youtu.be/U_nzqnXWvSo) from the book's author, James Clear.
