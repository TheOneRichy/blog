## SEO & analytics help you grow your site's traffic over time

Whether you're working on your own blog, a news site, or abuilding a product, you _absolutely must_ care about your site's SEO. If your site is not optimized for search engines, it is less likely to be found by users, which can lead to fewer visitors and potential customers. Additionally, SEO tools can help you improve the usability of your site, making it easier for users to find the information they are looking for. In short, SEO can help you build a better website that is more likely to be successful, and these are the tools that I use to monitor and enhance my sites' performance.

## Google Search Console

My adoption of [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) come from what I learned taking Monica Lent's [Blogging for Devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com) course.

You can register your site with the Google Search Console for free in a few quick steps, without adding Google Analytics (which is helpful if, like me, you've chosen [Fathom](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/why-fathom-analytics) for its privacy-first features).

The Search Console allows you to see how many people are getting to your page from Google, and what they're searching for. It also gives you a time-view of your site's growth in popularity from search - in other words, you can see whether you're gaining traction via SEO or not.

Best of all, it's free! Just register and follow instructions to add a DNS record, or upload a file to a specific place to verify that you own the site you're interested in monitoring. You should make sure to have a sitemap on your site - they're easy to generate, and worth the time to get right. This is what Google's crawlers primarily use to index your articles for search results.

I use the Search Console to make decisions about things to write about next, and track the progress of my site over time. At the moment, Google will keeps 16 months of your site's traffic history around for you to analyze, but that history starts once you've registered you site with the Search Console. So, the sooner you get set up, the better!

## Fathom Analytics

[Fathom](https://usefathom.com) is privacy first analytics for the web. According to their site, _Fathom is a Google Analytics alternative that doesnâ€™t compromise visitor privacy for data. We revolutionized website analytics by making them easy to use and respectful of privacy laws (like GDPR and more)._

If you've never paid attention analytics for your web properties, Fathom will be a revelation - it's super useful to have an understanding of which pages on your site are getting traffic, where that traffic is coming from, and what times of day are most busy.

If you've used Google Analytics in the past, you may be surprised just how freeing it is to use an analytics tool that prioritizes analytics. You _really_ don't need to know _who_ is on a given page - instead, focusing on the content on your site which is being visited, and the journey readers take to get there is a super useful tool to have when you're researching and writing new articles.

It's great, and puts your readers' privacy first. Google's advantage is quickly vanishing with GA4 due to new regulations and privacy tools that are being built into browsers and operating systems, and Fathom does a great job of providing value without fishing for every minute detail about your readers.

Fathom is lightweight and ridiculously easy to use. The Fathom team provides docs for a variety of platforms and JAMstack site builders, including [Gatsby](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/gatsby), [ConvertKit](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/convertkit), [Next.js](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/next), [Vue](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/vue), [Webflow](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/webflow), [Wordpress](https://usefathom.com/docs/integrations/wordpress), and quite a few more.

I've written a bit about my experiences with Fathom before. You may want to check out my other articles, including: [Why I switched to Fathom for Analytics](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/why-fathom-analytics) and [How to add Fathom Analytics to your Remix.run app](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/add-fathom-analytics-to-remix)

### Self-host Fathom for free - Fathom Lite

If you're hesitant to pay for Fathom, they do also provide an open source version called [Fathom Lite](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) - you'll need to configure and host it yourself, but it should give you an idea of what Fathom's premiums service is like.

If you're interested in trying out Fathom, use my **referral link:** use my referral link [https://usefathom.com/ref/DPSSYB](https://usefathom.com/ref/DPSSYB)\*\* for a discount to get you started.

## Cloudflare

I use [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to manage the DNS records for all of my sites. In addition to having a _really_ straightforward UI for DNS management, they offer a host of other features to keep your sites running well. This includes automated protection for DDoS attacks, maintenance mode, and performance enhancements such as origin server optimization and caching.

Cloudflare provides a [Free Tier](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/) that will work for most personal sites. You'll need to set up an account, look for the instructions to add your domain to your Cloudflare account, and then update your DNS settings as needed.

Because I own domains from a variety of registrars, it's really nice to be able to manage DNS for all of them in one place. They also provide a ton of other great dev tools, like [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), which you can use to add interactivity to your site.

## F5Bot

The pitch for [f5bot](https://f5bot.com) is simple - as they say, it is a service that will help you to "Get an email when you're mentioned online!".

It's completely free, and takes just moments to set up - you just need to create an account, and set up keywords for the service to track. When your keywords are mentioned on [Reddit](https://reddit.com), [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com), or [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), you'll get a tidy little email in your inbox.

Notifications come _very_ quickly - in my experience, I see them within minutes of my sites being mentioned online. This is hugely helpful because it allows you to respond quickly, strike up a conversation, and make a connection with the people who are sharing your work. Those connections are the backbone of building a great personal brand online.

You can set up any search keyword you want, so if there's a competitor or topic that you're hoping to keep an eye on, it's great for that, too.

Overall, I highly recommend [f5bot](https://f5bot.com) - it's an incredibly useful tool, it's free, and it couldn't be easier to set up.
