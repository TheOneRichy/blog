## A core use for note-taking: second brain as personal CRM

If you're like most people, you probably meet a lot of new people every week. Some of them may be potential clients or collaborators, while others may be friends or acquaintances you want to keep in touch with. But how do you keep track of all this information without letting it overwhelm you? One solution is to use a personal CRM, a system that helps you organize and manage your contacts and relationships. And one of the best tools for creating a personal CRM is a networked note-taking tool, such as Roam Research or Obsidian.

<Aside>

**CRM** stands for **Customer Relationship Management**. It is a term used in business to describe a system for managing customer relationships. It's a bit of a misnomer, as it's not just for businesses. You can also use a CRM to manage your personal relationships and keep track of information about your contacts.

In this article, it can be helpful to repurpose the acronym to mean _Contact Relationship Management._

## What is a personal CRM?

A **personal CRM** is a system that allows you to keep track of information about your contacts, such as their names, contact details, job titles, interests, and other relevant data. Unlike a traditional CRM system, which is designed for businesses to manage their customer relationships, a personal CRM is more focused on helping individuals build and maintain their personal and professional networks.

## Using a second brain as a personal CRM

So how can you use a networked note-taking tool as a personal CRM? Here are some tips based on my own experience:

### Keep track of metadata

One of the most useful features of a personal CRM is the ability to keep track of metadata about your contacts. This could include information such as where they work, where they live, their hobbies or interests, and even details about their family. By using tags or other metadata, you can easily find and sort your contacts based on these criteria.

### Keep a history of notes

Another useful feature is the ability to keep a history of notes about your interactions with your contacts. For example, you can create a page for each contact and add notes about times you spoke on the phone, met in person, or exchanged emails. This can be especially helpful for work-related contacts, as it allows you to easily refer back to past conversations and stay on top of your to-dos.

### Use backlinks and bi-directional linking

Networked note-taking tools like Roam and Obsidian have powerful linking features that allow you to connect notes together in a network. You can use this to your advantage by creating links between your personal CRM notes and other related notes, such as notes on companies or events that your contacts are associated with. This creates a web of information that makes it easier to see the big picture of your network and discover new connections.

### Use templates

To save time and ensure consistency, consider creating templates for your personal CRM notes. This could include fields for contact information, metadata, and notes about past interactions. You can then duplicate this template each time you add a new contact, making it easier to get started and ensuring that you capture all the necessary information.

## Tips for using networked note-taking tools as a personal CRM

Here are some additional tips for using networked note-taking tools as a personal CRM:

**Respect people's privacy:** While it's helpful to keep track of information about your contacts, it's also important to respect their privacy and avoid being creepy or invasive. Only include information that is publicly available or that your contact has shared with you directly.

**Keep it organized:** To make your personal CRM system more useful, it's important to keep it organized and easy to navigate. Consider creating a dedicated workspace for your personal CRM notes and using tags or other metadata to help you find relevant information quickly.

**Update regularly:** To ensure that your personal CRM is up-to-date and accurate, make a habit of updating it regularly. This could include adding new contacts, updating metadata, and adding notes about recent interactions.

## Give it a try

Using a networked note-taking tool as a personal CRM can be a powerful way to stay on top of your personal and professional contacts. By keeping track of metadata, creating a history of notes, and using backlinks and templates, you can build a powerful network of information that makes it easier to stay connected and discover new opportunities. So why not give it a try and see how it can help you manage your contacts more effectively?
