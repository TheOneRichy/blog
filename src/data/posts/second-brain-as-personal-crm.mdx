As a former Google and Stripe employee, and in my current role as CTO at a fresh new company called [Craftwork](https://craftwork.com), I know firsthand how difficult it can be to manage complex relationships across teams, projects, and companies. Managing all of this information can be obverwhelming, and it's easy to lose track of important details.

It doesn't have to be this way: **getting into the habit of taking notes** can be a life-changing habit that helps you stay organized and productive. But it's not enough to just take notes: you need to be able to find and organize them in a way that makes sense to you.

[I've gone all in on networked note-taking tools](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter/unlock-productivity-with-networked-note-taking) like Roam Research and Obsidian, to build a "second brain" that helps me stay on the ball.

This is the first post in a series about how I use these tools to stay organized and productive. In this post, I'll show you how I use a networked note-taking tool as a personal CRM to keep track of information about people I meet.

## A core use for note-taking: second brain as personal CRM

Even at a shiny new startup, I interact with a fair number of people every week in the normal course of my work. Whether I'm meeting with teammates, or Open Source collaborators, or guests on [one](https://mikebifulco.com/podcast) of [several](https://apisyouwonthate.com/podcast) tech [podcasts](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/), it's important to keep track of the people I meet and the relationships I build.

Thankfully, my note-taking habit dovetails nicely for this purpose. I've been using Roam Research to track information about people I meet with and the conversations we've had. In doing so, I'm **building a personal CRM**: a system that not only helps manage my contacts and relationships, but helps me remember details about our conversations far into the future.

<Aside>

**CRM** stands for **Customer Relationship Management**. It is a term used in business to describe a system for managing customer relationships. It's a bit of a misnomer, as it's not just for businesses. You can also use a CRM to manage your personal relationships and keep track of information about your contacts.

In this article, it can be helpful to repurpose the acronym to mean _Contact Relationship Management._

## What is a personal CRM?

A **personal CRM** is a system that allows you to keep track of information about your contacts, such as their names, contact details, job titles, interests, and other relevant data. Unlike a traditional CRM system, which is designed for businesses to manage their customer relationships, a personal CRM is more focused on helping individuals build and maintain their personal and professional networks.

## How I use my notes to build a personal CRM

I keep track of every meeting I have during the week in my notes. This includes a few important bits of information:

- The purpose of the meeting
- Who I'm meeting with
- Notes from the discussion
- any follow-up actions or tasks that result

For the purposes of this article, I'm going to focus on the second point: who I'm meeting with. In my notes, I create a tag for each person I meet with, by surrounding their name with double brackets, like this: `[[Mike Bifulco]]`. This tag creates a link to that person's page in my notes.

that contains information about that person. I use this page to keep track of metadata about the person, such as their name, email address, phone number, job title, company, and location. I also add notes about our conversation, including any relevant details about their work or interests.

Every time I meet someone new, I add a note to my personal CRM workspace in Roam. This note includes basic contact information, such as their name, email address, and phone number. I also include metadata about their job title, company, and location. I also add notes about our conversation, including any relevant details about their work or interests.

## Benefits of a personal CRM

So how can you use a networked note-taking tool as a personal CRM? Here are some tips based on my own experience:

### Keep track of metadata

One of the most useful features of a personal CRM is the ability to keep track of metadata about your contacts. This could include information such as where they work, where they live, their hobbies or interests, and even details about their family. By using tags or other metadata, you can easily find and sort your contacts based on these criteria.

### Keep a history of notes

Another useful feature is the ability to keep a history of notes about your interactions with your contacts. For example, you can create a page for each contact and add notes about times you spoke on the phone, met in person, or exchanged emails. This can be especially helpful for work-related contacts, as it allows you to easily refer back to past conversations and stay on top of your to-dos.

### Use backlinks and bi-directional linking

Networked note-taking tools like Roam and Obsidian have powerful linking features that allow you to connect notes together in a network. You can use this to your advantage by creating links between your personal CRM notes and other related notes, such as notes on companies or events that your contacts are associated with. This creates a web of information that makes it easier to see the big picture of your network and discover new connections.

### Use templates

To save time and ensure consistency, consider creating templates for your personal CRM notes. This could include fields for contact information, metadata, and notes about past interactions. You can then duplicate this template each time you add a new contact, making it easier to get started and ensuring that you capture all the necessary information.

## Tips for using networked note-taking tools as a personal CRM

Here are some additional tips for using networked note-taking tools as a personal CRM:

**Respect people's privacy:** While it's helpful to keep track of information about your contacts, it's also important to respect their privacy and avoid being creepy or invasive. Only include information that is publicly available or that your contact has shared with you directly.

**Keep it organized:** To make your personal CRM system more useful, it's important to keep it organized and easy to navigate. Consider creating a dedicated workspace for your personal CRM notes and using tags or other metadata to help you find relevant information quickly.

**Update regularly:** To ensure that your personal CRM is up-to-date and accurate, make a habit of updating it regularly. This could include adding new contacts, updating metadata, and adding notes about recent interactions.

## Give it a try

Using a networked note-taking tool as a personal CRM can be a powerful way to stay on top of your personal and professional contacts. By keeping track of metadata, creating a history of notes, and using backlinks and templates, you can build a powerful network of information that makes it easier to stay connected and discover new opportunities. So why not give it a try and see how it can help you manage your contacts more effectively?
