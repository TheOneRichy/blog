## Using color in your products design is complex

Color can be used to convey a message, evoke an emotion, or even change the way a user interacts with a product. It can also be _really_ difficult to get color right. There are cultural, historical, contextual, and even physiological factors that can influence how we perceive color.

Ever feel like you see colors differently than you partner, or your best friend, or your mom? It's not just you. Color perception is a very personal experience. A 1995 study published in the scientific journal _Perceptual and motor skills_ called [Blue versus periwinkle: color identification and gender](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7624204/) showed that _"the women identified significantly more elaborate colors than did the men"\*_

**The lesson:** As you build your products, it's in your best interest to understand your audience. How do your primary users perceive color? What words do they use to describe their environment? Can you use an existing color taxonomy system or product palette that speaks to your user base? Understanding the value systems, language, and expression of your users can help you better design an interface that is intuitive, speaks to the user, and fits their needs.

\* _it's worth calling out that our cultural understanding of the nuance of gender in 1995 was not the same as it is today. There are many peer-reviewed papers with similar experiments going back as far as the 1970s. This particular study measured "femininity"_

## How many colors are there?

If you grew up speaking english, you might rattle off the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

The colors we see are a universal truth, right?

Well, not exactly.

Different spoken languages can have have drastically different numbers of colors. This is likely a result of to the cultural and historical contexts that surrounded the development of a given language.

Different linguistic groups with different levels of technological sophistication developed over time, and depending on the size of the group and the need for communication, different color terms emerged in different languages. For example, the Bassa language (spoken by about half a million people in western africa) has only two terms to describe color — roughly equating to “light” and “dark” — while the Inuit language (spoken by about 50,000 people in the arctic) has 20 terms to describe color.

I love this diagram of the color wheel as described by the Irish language, which shows where various color words are placed on the wheel. It's a great example of how different languages can have different color.

The Wikipedia page for [Color Term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term) goes into much more detail about the history of color terms and how they have evolved over time. It's a great read.
