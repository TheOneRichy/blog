Have you ever felt that you've seen a design that just makes sense to you, but you couldn't quite put your finger on why?

At some point, we are all faced with the challenge of creating a design that works intuitively _and_ looks great. But what really makes a design intuitive and effective? Enter **Gestalt** principles, a set of psychological concepts that go beyond aesthetics to form the foundation of how we see and interpret user interfaces.

When building a new interface, there's a temptation to lean heavily on obvious design elements like color, shape, or a unique layout. We often forget that these are just parts of a much larger puzzle. The true essence of design lies not only in what you see but in how you see it.

The people who use are designs are silently and subconsciously navigating questions like: "What's the most important thing on this page?" "What's the relationship between these elements?" "What's the best way to navigate this interface?"

This is where the Gestalt principles come into play, guiding us to see the whole picture by understanding the sum of its parts.

The gist of understanding Gestalt principles for design is this: our brains are used to grouping things together based on a few basic patterns. These patterns are the foundation of how we perceive the world around us. By understanding these patterns, we can create designs that are easy to understand and navigate. Additionally, by _breaking_ these patterns, we can intentionally draw attention to specific elements in our designs.

## Some of the basic gestalt principles, in short:

- **Past Experience**: Our brains use our past experiences to interpret new information.
- **Proximity**: Elements that are close together are perceived as a group.
- **Similarity**: Elements that look similar are perceived as a group.
- **Figure and Ground**: Our brains separate elements into the background and the foreground.
- **Symmetry and Order**: Our brains perceive objects as symmetrical shapes that form around their center.

There are a few more principles, and they are all worth understanding. But for now, let's focus on how these principles can be applied to create better designs.

### Past Experience: the power of familiarity

In your mind, picture a web form used to collect someone's mailing address. You probably see a series of fields, each labeled with a specific piece of information: street address, city, state, and zip code. Where do each of these fields go? If you're like most people, you probably see the street address at the top, followed by the city, state, and zip code.

This is a perfect example of how past experience influences our perception of new information. We've seen this pattern so many times that we instantly recognize it and know how to interact with it.

### Proximity and Similarity: the power of grouping

Proximity and similarity are two of the most powerful tools in a designer's toolbox. They allow us to group elements together in a way that makes sense to the user. This is why one of the fundamental building blocks of most CSS design systems includes a grid system. It's a way to ensure that the space in your design is consistent and harmonious, guiding the user's eye and creating a sense of order and structure.

What does this mean? It means that the space around and between elements is just as important as the elements themselves. It's the difference between a cluttered, confusing design and a clean, intuitive one. Consistency is critical here: spacing between related elements should be consistent, and the space between unrelated elements should be distinct.

Let's go back to our address form example. If the gaps between rows and columns were inconsistent, you'd probably raise an eyebrow. It would feel off, and you'd be less likely to trust the form.


## Using color: A little can help, too much is a problem
Take color, for instance. It's a powerful tool in any designer's arsenal, but it's also a double-edged sword. Relying too much on color can lead to designs that fail for a variety of reasons. For instance, colorblind users may struggle to distinguish between different elements. As a reminder, something like 10% of all men have color deficient vision - more than you might think!

Conversely, too much use of color can make it difficult for people to understand what colors are meant to convey.

When I was working as a UX designer at Microsoft, it was common practice to design interfaces in black and white first. This was a way to ensure that the design was strong enough to stand on its own, without relying on color to convey meaning. Once the design was solid, we'd add color to enhance the experience, not define it. A truly successful design maintains its integrity even in black and white. This is a testament to the strength of its structure, spacing, and the overall harmony of elements - principles rooted deeply in Gestalt theory.

When color isn't the primary means of conveying information, it can be used to draw attention to specific elements. This is where the Gestalt principle of similarity comes into play. By using color to make certain elements stand out, you can guide the user's eye and create a sense of hierarchy.

One more time, back our ol' friend the address form: what's the plan when someone forgets to fill out a field? You could use color to highlight the empty field, drawing attention to it and making it clear that it needs to be filled out. This probably feels like a natural solution to you -- which is great! But it would have been far less useful if the entire form was already a rainbow of colors.

## Conclusion

Gestalt principles are a powerful tool for designers. They help us understand how people perceive and interpret the world around them, and they provide a framework for creating designs that are intuitive and easy to use. By understanding these principles, we can create designs that are not only visually appealing but also functional and effective.

I'm sure you've heard the old trope about how "breaking the rules" is the key to great design. In truth, it's hard to break the rules in a useful way if you don't understand them in the first place. Gestalt principles provide a solid foundation for understanding how people perceive and interpret the world around them, and they can help you create designs that are both visually appealing and easy to use.
