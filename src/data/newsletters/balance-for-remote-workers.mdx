Hey there,

I hope you had a great week. I [spoke at a conference](https://twitter.com/fintechdevcon/status/1562477596343816193) called Fintech Devcon last week in Denver, Colorado, about how we use Friction Logs to make our products better at Stripe.

It was the first time I had traveled for work in a while, and I found it extremely refreshing. The recording for my talk should be available soon - I'll be sure to share it once it is live.

I was also able to explore Denver a bit while I was there. The River North Arts District (or Rino) was great fun - I can see why people are moving there in droves.

üìù Finding balance as a remote worker - I wrote an article on the Third Space and why it is important for remote workers finding balance. It was a super fun project to work on and I'm excited to share it with you. It's called "[The third place - the secret to a happy life for remote workers](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/remote-work-and-the-third-place)".
