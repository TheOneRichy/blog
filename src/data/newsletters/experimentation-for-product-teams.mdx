As a product builder, it can be tempting to dive head first into using every new tool or library that comes along. In many cases, this can be good. If you're hearing about a new tool a lot, it's usually for a reson. Most often, this is some variety of performance benefits, improved UX, or better developer experience.

These are all good things -- but it's important to remember that not every new tool is a good fit for every project.

If you're building something, you've probably found yourself needing to make decisions like this already. **Should my team use postgres or firebase? Maybe Supabase? What's MariaDB? I heard DyanmoDB is really fast...** or **Should we use React or Vue? What about Svelte? What's Solid.js? Next.js has that new App router...**

Choosing the right tools for your project is a critical part of the development process, and learning to experiment quickly and make informed decisions is a foundational skill for engineers. As I see it, there's several benefits to testing out new tech to see if it is a fit for your team:

## Productivity

It's rare that a new tool comes along with a _completely_ new value proposition or feature set. Most often, the new tool is a better version of something that already exists. If adopting a new tool can make your team markedly more productive, it may be worth the investment to switch.

## Learning

like it or not, learning new things is a skill which needs to be practiced. When you intentionally take the time to test out a new library, you're keeping this skill sharp. This will pay dividends in the future when you need to learn something new.

## Energy

Developer burnout is a real and **very** expensive thing. In my opionion, many devs burn out because they feel stagnant, and get stuck working on the same thing for too long. Sometimes, kicking the tires on a new tool can be just the thing to breathe some life back into a tired engineer.

But experimenting with new tools can also be time-consuming and risky. If you're not careful, you could end up wasting time and money on tools that don't work for you.

That's why it's important to be strategic about how you experiment with new tools. Here are a few tips:

- Start small. Don't try to change everything at once. Start by experimenting with one or two new tools at a time.
- Set clear goals. What do you hope to achieve by experimenting with new tools? Make sure you have a clear understanding of what you're trying to accomplish.
- Be patient. It takes time to learn how to use new tools effectively. Don't expect to see results overnight.

In addition to the benefits mentioned above, testing new tools can also help keep engineering teams aware of their product's strengths and weaknesses. By experimenting with different tools, teams can learn what works well for their specific needs and what doesn't.

Finally, keeping a culture of curiosity and continuous improvement will benefit customers and end users in the long run.

## Some heuristics for testing new tools

There aren't hard and fast rules for whether or not your t eam should adopt a new integration. This can sometimes feel uncomfortable, but it's actually a good thing. It means you have the freedom to make decisions that are best for your team and product. These are some of the questions I ask when deciding whether or not to test out a new tool:

### 1. Is there a clear value proposition?

If you're going to test out a new tool, it should be because it solves a problem you're having. If you're not sure what problem it solves, it's probably not worth your time. Similarly, if adopting a new tool doesn't make your team or product measurably better, it's probably not worth the investment.

### 2. Is it stable, working, and well documented?

If you're at the bleeding edge of the tech adoption curve, you may notice that the tool you're adopting feels a little underbaked. It's not always a great idea to adopt a tool that's still in beta. If you do, make sure you're aware of the risks and have a plan for how to mitigate them. One important signal to look for is whether or not the company or team building your new tools is responsive and actually **shipping** new features and bug fixes. Often, this means an active Discord or Slack team, or a Github repo with a lot of discussion and activity.
