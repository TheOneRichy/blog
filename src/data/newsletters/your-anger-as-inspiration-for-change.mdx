## The Big Idea

Sometimes, being mad is the best way to start something new.

## Stay mad

I was walking home the other night, feeling lucky. I have a great job, a short walk home, and live in a city built for walking and biking. It was a rare moment recently where I wasn't just angry, anxious, or sad about the world.

I'm mad about the state of politics in the US. A lot of people voted for someone who thinks they're above the law. But in that moment of reflection, I realized I'm lucky to be mad. I have the freedom to feel this frustration - unlike so many others who can't afford it or fear consequences if they speak up.

That feeling reminded me of starting Craftwork. My cofounders, Tim and Suzanne, were fed up with the frustrating process of hiring painters. Their anger sparked an idea, and they built a solution.

The truth is, sometimes being mad is exactly what you need to create change. So many companies were born from frustration - Airbnb, Uber, Slack, Resend - because something just wasn't good enough. Anger, when channeled right, can be a powerful force.

If you're looking for a product idea or a business to start, try asking yourself: What makes you mad?

Get mad about it, and go fix it.

Fix it for good.

## Catch up with me on Bluesky

Bluesky is a decentralized social network whose success is largely due to frustration: Twitter's hostile takeover and toothless leadership left many people looking for a new home.

There has been a _massive_ migration of people moving from Twitter to Bluesky; the tech community is absolutely humming with activity lately.
