## Hey, that's the name of the show!

Today I want to talk about why my newsletter is called Tiny Improvements. For me, personal growth has come by way of small, incremental changes that have compounded over time.

Throughout my life, I've relied on building intentional personal habits to stay productive. When the pandemic hit in 2020 and we found ourselves in an extended lockdown, something changed.

I found myself instinctually leaning on habits to help me stay grounded and optimistic. I've always found small habits to be helpful, and during the pandemic, I used my routines to gradually build towards big changes in my life. It was a time where there was little consistency in the world to rely on, and I found that my habits were a source of stability.

Since then, these are three habits that have stuck around in my daily routine:

### The morning ritual

Every morning, I make myself an espresso, and sit down at my kitchen counter while the sun comes up. I set a timer for 5 minutes, and start writing anything that comes to mind.

I've been using journaling as a form of self-reflection and mental decluttering. By using a simple template in my note-taking app, I jot down any thoughts that cross my mind, no matter how trivial or insignificant they may seem. This daily practice has allowed me to better understand my thought patterns and emotions while setting a clear, focused tone for the day ahead.

I also try to a few minutes each day meditating. I've been using [Headspace for this](https://www.headspace.com/referral/z6jb3?slug=cebee0&audio=false) (that's a referral link for 30 days free, btw!), and it has made a world of difference for stress management and mental clarity. I generally do 3 or 5 minute sessions - it's shocking how much difference that little bit of time makes.

## Language Learning

For the past 1,000 days, I've been using Duolingo to sharpen my Spanish skills and learn Japanese and Mandarin. _A thousand days!_ Do you know what you were doing 1,000 days ago? I had to look it up -- that would be July of 2020.

Doubling down on language learning has proved invaluable as I work on my new business, [Craftwork](https://craftwork.com). Many of my new colleagues speak Spanish as their first language, and although I'm far from fluent, it will certainly help to build relationships and trust with my new teammates.

I've also been learning Japanese and Mandarin -- these are languages I'd love to be able to understand, and although it's been a massive challenge to get started, I'm making progress. I'm not sure if I'll ever be fluent, but I'm enjoying the process of learning something new.

My top tip for practicing a second language is to _get out of your comfort zone_ and try to communicate with native speakers whenever possible. I have never had a bad experience with this - people are generally very kind and apreciative, and it's a great way to learn.

## Writing

Launching [my website](https://mikebifulco.com) and [Tiny Improvements](https://mikebifulco.com/newsletter) has given me a platform to showcase my professional work and share my opinions with others. Writing consistently has not only helped me refine my thoughts and ideas but also allowed me to build an audience who appreciates my perspective. As a result, I've created a strong personal brand that's anchored in my dedication to growth, self-improvement, and meaningful communication.

These three habits, though seemingly small, have played a significant role in shaping my personal brand and paving the way for my success in various aspects of life. Remember, it's the tiny improvements that accumulate over time, ultimately leading to profound and lasting changes.

## Resources for building habits

- [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3n33Ehe) by James Clear is the de facto guide to building habits. James has made an incredible career out of building habits for himself.
- My journaling habit is loosely based on [Morning Pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/), writing technique created by artist Julia Cameron. I love the idea of writing without judgement or expectation, but I rarely have it in me to bash out 3 pages of notes... and I am _definitely_ not hand-writing mine. Do what works for you!
- If you use Roam Research for taking notes, feel free to grab my [Morning Pages Template](https://gist.github.com/mbifulco/1357dde391d866c6a14d492b06414581). It is hyper-minimal by design to avoid overcomplicating my writing process.
