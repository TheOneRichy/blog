If there's one thing I appreciate about the internet, it's people who find themselves fixated on a topic, and go _really_ deep to research and find the answer to a question. It's a helpful reminder that the internet puts huge power at our fingertips, and the connections available to us are truly incredible. There's something really special about watching people become experts on a topic, and then watching experts do their thing.

Is hyperfixation a good thing? Maybe. Not always. But it's a good thing when it leads to something useful.

There is a similar pattern I see in many of the best engineers I know - a simple need or curiosity will lead to something much larger. Chasing down a solution is often just a series of small questions that need to be asked and answered in order, rolling up to a larger goal.

A few examples from the tech world:

- My friend Charlie found herself wondering about the jets she could see from her apartment window in Seattle. One thing lead to another, and she built a javascript app that gives her [real-time information](https://charliegerard.dev/blog/aircraft-radar-system-rtl-sdr-web-usb/) on the planes whizzing by her window from live, public radio signal broadcasts.
- Curiosity about modifying the generator command in Ruby on Rails led my teammate CJ deep into the weeds of the [RoR source code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rnf_-vDuaU&) to figure out how it all works, and how to make it better - his work will likely find its way upstream into core parts of the rails ecosystem before long.

## My own hyperfixation

A friend recently recommended a _3-hour long podcast about Costco_ to me from the show Acquired - and while it is an incredible deep dive, it also requires a huge time commitment to get through. I listened to the show, and wanted to chat about it with my teammates, but I knew that it was unlikely they'd have the time to listen the entire 3-hour show.

So, I did what any good engineer would do, and I figured out a way to summarize the show's transcript for each of my teammates in a way that was personalized and relevant to them. I built a little tool that would take the transcript, and then use a series of natural language processing tools to summarize the transcript into a few key points.

In a short amount of time, I found myself learning about:

- **The Podcast RSS feed format**, which contains audio files and metadata about individual episodes. I used this to grab both a show mp3 and transcript to use for summarization.
- **OpenAI's Whisper API**, which can be used to quickly transcribe audio files into text.
- The **GPT-4 API Playground,** where I could play around with different summarization models to see which one worked best for my use case.
- **LLM Prompt writing** for summarization, and ways to ask the model to summarize an episode for a specific listener's perspective, like our head of growth or a software engineer. Clearly, these two personas will have different interests in a show about Costco -- so I wanted to make sure the summary was relevant to them.

I ended up with a tool that I could use to summarize any podcast episode, and I learned a ton along the way.

### Read summaries of the Costco episode generated by AI

Sounds cool, right? I published a few sample summaries of the episode in an [article on my site here](/posts/acquired-costco-podcast-llm-summaries) for you to check out.

Is this something you'd a small amount for? [Drop me a line](mailto:hello@mikebifulco.com) or shout at me on [threads](https://threads.net/@irreverentmike) - I'd love to hear your thoughts.

These are a few incredible examples of people who have gone above and beyond to pursue answers to _non-technical_ questions:

### The Mystery of the Bloomfield Bridge

[The Mystery of the Bloomfield Bridge](https://tylervigen.com/the-mystery-of-the-bloomfield-bridge) may be the single most interesting article I've read this year. It shows how a seemingly simple question about the built environment can uncover a long and winding history of civic action, economic change, and a bridge that doesn't seem to go anywhere.

### Finding Michaelsoft Binbows

YouTuber Nick Robinson's 42-minute long vlog titled [I flew to Japan to visit "Michaelsoft Binbows" in person](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QRIklga9IBQ) is actually a follow-up to a previous video where he tried to find the real-life inspiration for the Microsoft Binbows logo. Don't know what the hell that means? Neither did I, but I watched both videos and I'm glad I did. The internet is a weird place.

### üì∞ API Specs, Schemas and Standards

In the latest edition of the APIs You Won't Hate Newsletter, my pal Alex goes deep on [API Specs, Schemas and Standards](https://apisyouwonthate.com/newsletter/api-specs-schemas-and-standards/) - what's the difference between JSON Schema and JSON:API? Find out here.

### üéôÔ∏è The future of HTTP - software engineering daily podcast

I did a super in-depth interview about [The Future of HTTP](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2023/10/11/the-future-of-http/) with Nick and Roman, two engineers from Nginx working on a standard that is one of the most basic building blocks of the web. I genuinely had to study up on HTTP basics for this one, and learned a ton. I hope you do too!

### üß¨ Your Resume Sucks

The gang over at Polywork liked my recent newsletter on resume writing so much that they [reposted it on their blog](https://blog.polywork.com/how-to-fix-your-resume/) for the world to see. I'm happy to see that it's resonating with people, and I hope it helps you land your next job!
