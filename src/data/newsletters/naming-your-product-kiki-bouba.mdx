title: "Product naming: sometimes it's not about the product"
excerpt: "Naming a product is hard. Naming a product that doesn't exist yet is even harder. But sometimes it's not about the product at all."

Have you ever stumbled upon a product with a brand name or design that didn't seem to match what it was selling? Maybe a company with a name that sounded more like a tech startup than a food delivery service, or a logo that seemed to have nothing to do with the industry it represented. In the world of branding, creating a cohesive and effective identity can be a challenging task.

One reason for this challenge is the Bouba/kiki effect. This phenomenon refers to the tendency for people to associate certain shapes and sounds with specific meanings. For example, most people would agree that a spiky shape, like that of the letter "k," looks and sounds more aggressive than a soft, round shape, like the letter "o." Our brains are wired to make these associations, which can create certain expectations for what a brand should look and sound like based on its industry.

Cultural expectations also play a role in brand naming and design. Certain industries have established norms for what kinds of names and visual designs are appropriate. For example, a bank would typically have a more serious and traditional name and logo, while a new clothing brand might opt for a more playful and trendy identity.

However, some brands have succeeded by defying these expectations. Take the company Liquid Death, for example. They sell canned water, a product that is typically seen as boring and unremarkable. But instead of playing into the industry norms for water branding - think serene images of nature and soft, flowing typography - Liquid Death went in the opposite direction. They created a bold and aggressive design, complete with a skull logo and edgy typography. The result? A massive success, with fans across social media and even a mention on a popular TV show.

So, what can we learn from this? When designing a brand, it's important to consider the industry and cultural expectations, but also to be willing to take risks and stand out from the crowd. By understanding the Bouba/kiki effect and using it to your advantage, you can create a visual and linguistic identity that resonates with your audience and sets you apart from the competition. And who knows, you might just create the next Liquid Death.
