From my days working as Technical Director of [thegymnasium.com](https://thegymnasium.com): a 5-minute tutorial (lovingly referred to as a **Take 5**) showing how you can use GitHub pages to host your very own website.

The full tutorial (with additional reference material) is available **for free** on [The Gymnasium](https://thegymnasium.com/courses/take5/publishing-your-first-github-pages-website)
