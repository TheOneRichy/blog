From a talk I gave at my then-home-base [Hygge Coworking](https://wearehygge.com/) at a community event. The thesis: we're all designers, and you should give a damn about the things you put into the world.

Slides are [available on slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/mbifulco1/matter-a-whole-thing-about-design).
