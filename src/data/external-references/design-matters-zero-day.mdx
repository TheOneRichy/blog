These are slides from an empassioned talk I gave about design during a community event called Zero Day at [Hygge Coworking](https://wearehygge.com) in Charlotte, NC, USA.

The thesis: good design is important, and you should be paying attention to good-and-bad design in the world around you. Contributing to making the world better for everyone **is** everyone's job.
