# The stack
This is a [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org) site, built on top of a lovely starter called [Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/gatsby-starter-hello-friend) from a fantastic designer named [Radek Koziel](https://github.com/panr).  I'd encourage you to give his starter a look.  I've modified it for my own uses - but he deserves credit for getting me off to a flying start.
